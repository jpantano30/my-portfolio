        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a dog and fitness enthusiast. I started CrossFit 5 years ago and now coach to share my passion with others. You can find my dogs, Paisley and Tallulah, and me at our local CrossFit gym most mornings.

          My journey into nutrition started in high school after attending a horticultural camp in Hawaii. Since then, I've been transforming my favorite dishes into nutritious meals. My interest in cooking and baking was inspired by my grandfather, a professional chef who once cooked for the Queen of England.
          <br /><br />
          Before pursuing a culinary career, I studied psychology and started a master's program in clinical mental health counseling. Although I chose a different path, the knowledge gained continues to influence my life.
          <br /><br />
          In my free time, I enjoy CrossFit, cooking, baking, skiing, and traveling.

Afterward, I pursued my passion for cooking by attending culinary school, where I worked as a baker, pastry chef, and cake decorator.
          <br /><br />
          My journey into software engineering began when I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp, completing a 500-hour training program. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Software Development at Boston University.

          My goal is to create impactful solutions in the health and fitness tech industry, leveraging my diverse background and technical skills.
